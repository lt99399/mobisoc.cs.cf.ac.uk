The Recognition project looked for innovative ways to autonomously provide and manage content relevant to the individual user. The project was inspired by the cognitive processes that humans exhibit for self-awareness. Examples incude the heuristics and cues that we subconsciously use everyday for rapid decision making and negotiating conflicting signals in physical and social situations.

The Recognition project wass a part of the Self-Awareness in Autonomic Systems Initiative (AWARENESS) in the Future Emerging Technology section of the EU 7th Framework Programme.

The main results can be summarised as follows:

* Identification of key general principles from psychology for creating awareness in ICT systems. 
* Development of a new model for functional cognition, called the tri-partite model, which can act as a blue print for ICT system design. 
* Demonstration of how social and cognitive based psychology can be applied in new ways for the consumption, dissemination and management of content. 
* Insights into how ICT is impacting on human behaviour.

These results act as a proof of concept and show the ways in which different awareness can be enhanced in ICT through the use of social, psychological and cognitive approaches. In addition a number of success stories have been achieved. These include:

* Cross-disciplinary understanding and awareness of ways in which cognitive heuristics can be applied for efficient decision making in real-time data-driven environments;
* Large scale participatory experimentation that has involved users from across the globe for social media based research;
* Release of an app allowing prototyping, for the first time, of personality based recommendation in a geo-spatial context;
* Development of simulation code to support simulation of key aspects of the scientific work from the project;
* Exposure of the project to psychologists, throughout its development. 

The project has contributed to the development of results that are now being carried forward for further exploration.
