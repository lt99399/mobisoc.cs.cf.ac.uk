Our first meeting of 2016 has been arranged for 12pm, Thursday 24th March. No room has been booked yet, but we're pretty sure a room booking will occur.

Not sure what we're going to talk about. Probably "What Research am I Doing Right Now?". You can bet we'll be shouting about this lovely new website too...
